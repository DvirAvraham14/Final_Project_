It's a player's turn in front of a computer. The player in his turn selects one tile he wants to block by clicking
Mouse on the desired circle. The computer in its turn moves the cat to try to escape obstacles, and to escape
From the board. If the cat reached one side of the board, the cat actually ran away from the board and won the game. If the player succeeded
